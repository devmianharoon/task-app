# Next.js Frontend with FastAPI Backend Integration

This project combines a frontend built with Next.js and a backend developed using FastAPI. The integration allows seamless communication between the two, enabling dynamic data retrieval and manipulation.

## Project Structure

The project structure consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend**:

   - Built with Next.js, a React framework for server-rendered React applications.
   - Utilizes components like `InputTask` and `TodoList` to manage tasks.
   - Fetches tasks from the backend using asynchronous calls.

2. **Backend**:
   - Developed using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.11+.
   - Exposes endpoints to handle CRUD operations for tasks.
   - Provides endpoints for retrieving tasks.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Python 3.11+ (for FastAPI backend)
- pip (Python package manager)
